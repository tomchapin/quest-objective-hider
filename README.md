# quest-objective-hider

Do you use an alternate quest tracker addon (such as Zygor Guides or RestedXP) and hate how you have to keep minimizing the default WoW quest/objective tracker every time you reload the UI?

This addon will completely hide the built-in quest / achievement objective tracker (the WatchFrame UI frame) on load. That's all it does. It's literally one line of code!

Tested with WoTLK Classic
